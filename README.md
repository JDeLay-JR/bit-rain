# Bit Rain: A Bitcoin Transaction Monitor

## Description

This application connects to the Blockchain WebSocket API and renders a "rain drop" for each transaction and block created since the user opened the site. There is also a ticker to keep track of the total number of transactions and blocks created during that time period.

## Future Goals

Create a clean-up mechanism to remove the Rain Drop components that are no longer visible on the screen.

Tweak the Details component to be mobile-friendly.

Add a "most valuable transaction/block" feature to monitor the most valuable transaction/block that was created during the time a user was monitoring the blockchain stream.
